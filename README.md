# Stock-Trading-Algorithm-1
A simple stock trading algorithm using a moving average crossover. You can control the short moving average and the long moving average. Using apple stock with a short MA of 5 and a long MA of 26 I got a 33% return over a three year period.

This is my first stock trading algorithm and it is very simple and only uses historic data from yfinance from 2020-01-01 to 2023-01-01. This was during a time when apple shares decreased from $148 to $128, so I am very pleased with a 33% return on my investment.
